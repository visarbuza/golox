# golox

I will share my progress on trying to build golox which is an interpreter for the Lox language following the 
[Crafting Interpreters book](https://craftinginterpreters.com)

## Running it

```bash
go build .
```

Interactive mode (REPL)

```bash
./golox
```

Input file

```bash
.golox file.lox
```

### Current Progres

- Defining the lanugage tokens and grammar
- Scanning (Lexing)
- Representing code
- Parsing expressions
- Evaluating expressions

### Next
- Statements and state
- Control flow
- Functions
- Resolving and binding
- Classes
- Inheritance
